      <description>&lt;p&gt;Im Starting a Blog where i just post some Tech &amp;ldquo;Tutorials&amp;rdquo; (its not Really Tutorials but just the way that was i doing it) and some things about my Life (Like my Hackerspace and this Things). Im Starting with this here and here i explain how  i do it (With a Tutorial-Like Thing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-write-it&#34;&gt;How i write it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write it in Obsidian, Obisidian is a Markdown Editor and it has cool Features but the Main Reason i use it, is because it shows me the Hashtags with the Right Format (and a Friend told me to use so i tested it and it was good)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
